# Color Harmony Generator
 The Color Harmony Generator project is designed to showcase my skills in using APIs with JavaScript, while also providing an opportunity to improve my HTML and CSS skills. This project utilizes the powerful "The Color API" to generate beautiful color schemes based on user input of an initial color.
